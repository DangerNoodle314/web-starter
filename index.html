    <p>Well the best way to describe myself is a chaos gremlin, or a jinx; It may just be that I have ADHD.
        To Get the superficial things out of the way, let's get to it. I'm an Aquarius, which in itself is an existential crisis.
        I'm 25, quiet , kind, and delusional  --not really--  . I say "KaChow" a lot, especially when I'm in the zone.
        I feel like a shaking chihuahua steadfast in front of a vacuum is a good description of 
        how I appear to people. I also reference emotion through oddly accurate memes and gifs. I love to play videogames --mainly minecraft and games like it--
        don't get me wrong TitanFall 2 and Battlefield are super fun to play too.  
        
        Digging deeper, I am constantly questioning reality; how things work, what we as humans can achieve. This is typically manifests in dystopian fantasy.
        I believe that humanity can change for the better, one kind gesture at a time. I used to think being a lone wolf was cool, but I realized 
        having people to lean on and support you at your worst times. I wear rose colored glasses on people, I look to their best .
